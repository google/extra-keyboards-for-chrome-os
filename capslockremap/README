This adds a German keyboard with a comma on the numpad (instead of a dot; see German in chrome://setting/languages)

Known issues:
 - CapsLock is still kicking in (see crbug.com/339654)

Remaining work:
 - workaround above issue by cancelling CapsLock (remapping keyevent to their unshifted counterparts)
