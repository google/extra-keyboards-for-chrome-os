## For development

1. Go to chrome://extensions.
2. Click on "Load unpacked extensions...".
3. Pick the directory containing the manifest for the extension you want to
enable.

## How to Use

After enabling multiple keyboard layouts an icon will appear in the system tray
with an abbreviation for the *language* of the currently enabled layout. If
your default layout is the standard US keyboard with the English layout, the
text will read "US". Any other layout also using the English language will read
"EN". This can lead to confusion if there are multiple layouts enabled for the
same language.

Once you have loaded and enabled the extension you can select a specific layout
or cycle through the available layouts in a few ways.

### Selecting

- Click the time on the menu bar.
- Click the button labeled "Keyboard" and select the desired layout.

### Cycling

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space` to cycle through the enabled keyboard layouts.
1. Press `Ctrl+Space` to toggle between the most recently used keyboard layouts.
